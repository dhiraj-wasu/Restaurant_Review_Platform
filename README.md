Restaurant Review Platform with NLP Analysis
Overview
The Restaurant Review Platform is designed to provide a scalable and high-performance system for
managing restaurant reviews, sentiment analysis, and real-time analytics. By leveraging NLP for
sentiment classification, Redis for caching and leaderboard management, Celery for asynchronous
task processing, and secure authentication, the platform ensures efficiency and seamless integration
with external services like Swiggy.
Tech Stack
• Backend: Django (Python), Django REST Framework (DRF)
• Frontend: React (JavaScript/TypeScript)
• Database: PostgreSQL
• Caching & Queues: Redis, Celery
• Machine Learning: NLP
• Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
Key Features & Functionalities
1. Sentiment Analysis Engine
• Built an NLP pipeline using NLTK and BERT for review sentiment classification.
• Achieved 92% accuracy in detecting positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
• Capable of processing 500+ reviews per minute for large-scale operations.
2. Real-time Leaderboards
• Implemented Redis Sorted Sets for dynamic restaurant ranking.
• Scoring based on multiple parameters, including ratings, response time, and popularity.
• Enables instant leaderboard updates with minimal latency.
3. High-performance Caching
• Designed a Redis cache hierarchy to optimize API response times.
• Reduced API latency from 2.1 seconds to 380ms, ensuring smooth user experience.
